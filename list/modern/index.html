  <h1>Modern computers</h1>
  <p>The principle of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing in his seminal 1936 paper,
     On Computable Numbers. Turing proposed a simple device that he called "Universal Computing machine"
     and that is now known as a universal Turing machine. He proved that such a machine is capable of computing 
     anything that is computable by executing instructions stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. 
     The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the stored program, where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory. </p>

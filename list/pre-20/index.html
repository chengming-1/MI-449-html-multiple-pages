  <h1>Pre-20 century computers</h1>
  <p>Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, 
    mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest 
    counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout 
    the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, 
    probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.</p>
